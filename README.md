A simple and easy-to-use app that helps you with making decisions.
Create decision makers with multiple decision options and let the app select a random decision for you!
This project is in active development at the moment, so except more features to come and existing ones to change!

## Local Project Setup

If you wish to mess around with the code yourself, you need to [install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) first,
then fork this project and clone it to your computer. Next, run `flutter pub get` to download all dependencies.
The Dart file providing the localizations isn't included in the project by default. Run `flutter gen-l10n` to generate it.

For Android testing, [set up an Android emulator](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows#android-setup).
If you wish to test the project for iOS, you need to be running Xcode on a macOS system.

To run all automated tests, use `flutter test`.
